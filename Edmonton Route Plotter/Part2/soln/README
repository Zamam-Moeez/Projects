Program definition:

Calls readGraph() to build graph 

main():

Builds WDigraph graph using readGraph()

client.py communicates with server.cpp using inpipe and outpipe

client sends request through inpipe in the form <start lat> <start lon>\n <end lat> <end lon>
server computes dijkstra algorithm on this and sends way points through outpipe in the form <lat> <lon>\n
sends "E\n" when no waypoints left.
Then goes into a state of waiting for the next request from client

When map window is closed client sends "Q" to server which results in server closing along with inpipe, outpipe

Running Instructions:

run <make server> in server folder to create executable
then run <make run> in soln folder in order to open map
use W/A/S/D or left mouse button to move around the map
use left mouse button to click on start and end points
